Insights from the Images
Clusters (leftmost plot)

The scatter plot likely represents clusters of books based on a specific numeric relationship, such as average_rating vs ratings_count or a derived clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means).
There appear to be 3 distinct clusters, potentially dividing books into:
Highly rated with fewer ratings (upper region, green)
Moderately rated (middle region, green)
Lower ratings with fewer visibility (bottom red cluster).
Correlation Matrix (center plot)

The heatmap showcases correlations between numerical features. Key observations may include:
Strong positive correlations (red) between related features like ratings_count and average_rating.
A focus on ratings_4 and ratings_5 contributing more significantly to overall average ratings.
Possible negative or neutral correlations between publication year and rating trends.
Outliers (rightmost plot)

This bar chart likely shows outlier counts per cluster or category.
A few clusters dominate outliers, indicating that some books may have received disproportionately high or low ratings compared to others.
