The dataset contains 2,363 entries and 11 columns, which represent various metrics related to happiness and well-being for different countries across years. Here’s a summary:

Country name: Name of the country.
year: Year of observation.
Life Ladder: Self-reported life evaluation (subjective happiness score).
Log GDP per capita: Logarithmic value of GDP per capita.
Social support: Perceived social support.
Healthy life expectancy at birth: Expected healthy lifespan at birth.
Freedom to make life choices: Perceived freedom in life decisions.
Generosity: Perception of generosity in society.
Perceptions of corruption: Perceived corruption levels (higher values indicate higher corruption).
Positive affect: Measures positive emotional experiences.
Negative affect: Measures negative emotional experiences.




Let’s now analyze the visualizations you provided:

Clusters:

This visualization likely groups countries based on similar happiness and economic factors.
From the image, the clustered patterns are color-coded, which indicates distinct groupings. Such clusters could reflect shared socioeconomic conditions, geographic proximity, or cultural similarities.
Correlation Matrix:

This heatmap visualizes the correlations between numerical features.
Dark red and blue squares show strong positive and negative correlations, respectively. For instance:
Log GDP per capita and Life Ladder might show a strong positive correlation.
Perceptions of corruption could negatively correlate with happiness-related metrics (e.g., Life Ladder, Positive affect).
Outliers:

This chart identifies columns with outlier values.
From the image, two columns (e.g., Generosity and possibly Perceptions of corruption) show significant outliers, suggesting some countries deviate markedly from the typical trends.
